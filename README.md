# Card Game

Welcome to my first SwiftUI project - The card game. The rules are simple, press the deal button, both you and the computer will be randomly given a card. Whoever get's the highest card (A is high) wins a point. Play to your heart's content.

This project was a great opportunity to develop the core foundation skills using XCode and SwiftUI. Some of the key tings I learned were:

- Setup an xcode SwiftUI project
- Use the XCode functionality (library, preview etc.)
- Developing the user interface. Stacks, Spacers, library controls & modifiers
- learning the Swift language syntax and asigning types to variables
- giving variables a state
